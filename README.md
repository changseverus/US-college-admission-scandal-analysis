# US-college-admission-scandal-analysis


Use generalized linear model and panel data model to analyze the data related to US college admission, see how background/ethnicity/education/income... all these various variables affect how one would enroll in college or not.

Also observe how certain variables like ethnicity and family income affect individuals that have similar background in all other features,
hopefully gain some insight about social discrimination and injustice of college admission.


# Just for the record, this analysis is JUST FOR RESEARCH, not meant to discriminate or judge anybody based on their skin color or family background...etc.
